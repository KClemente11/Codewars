// Description:
// Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

// Style Points
// Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative hello world you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

function greet() {
    const h = "h"
    const e = "e"
    const ll = "ll"
    const o = "o"
    const space = " "
    const w = "w"
    const r = "r"
    const l = "l"
    const d = "d"
    const bang = "!"
    
    return (h + e + ll + o + space + w + o + r + l + d + bang).toString()
  }

  // or

  function greet() {
    return "hello world!"
  }
